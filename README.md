After registration, a cluster for you will be provisioned on Azure.

When the cluster is provisioned, you can start the workshop using the document **CDH_NiFi_Kafka_Kudu labs for IBM.pdf**, also 
available in this repository.

When the lab is completed, you may want to continue with more complex labs. You have 2 options:
